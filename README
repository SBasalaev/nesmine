NESMine is a port of the Minesweeper game from the popular operating
system to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, Famicom).


Building prerequisites:

To compile the project you will need xa65 or compatible
compiler. It can be obtained from
	http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/
Users of Debian and its derivatives may want to install it using
	$ apt-get install xa65


Building process:

Building is simple as long as you familiar with the command line.
To build ROM on the Unix system use command `make'.
To do the same under DOS or Windows system launch `make.bat'

After that playable ROM can be found in the "dist" subdirectory.
	
	
Using:

To play ROM you will need a NES emulator. Many of them can be found
on the internet. Just start it with the file "nesmine.nes" from the
"dist" subdirectory as parameter or use File->Open... from the menu
after starting emulator.
	
	
Troubleshooting:

If your build failed for reason "Command not found" or "File not found"
that means your system cannot find the xa65 executable. In this case
open build file you need (Makefile or make.bat) and replace path to the
xa65 executable in the first line to the correct one, for example
  XA=/usr/bin/xa
in Makefile on Unix-like systems or
  set XA=C:\Xa65\xa.exe
in make.bat on DOS-like systems.
